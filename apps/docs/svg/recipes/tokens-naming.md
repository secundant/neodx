# Recommended Token Naming

::: danger
WIP; TODO UPDATE BEFORE RELEASE
:::

In our examples, we use the following naming convention:

```tsx
<Icon name="sprite-name:symbol-name" />
```

This approach supports any possible sprite or symbol name, such as possible nested grouping like `common/actions/24:close` (`<global group>/<...subgroup>/<size>/<symbol>`).
