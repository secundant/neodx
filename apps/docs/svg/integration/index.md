# `@neodx/svg` Integration with frameworks

::: danger
WIP; TODO UPDATE BEFORE RELEASE
:::

`@neodx/svg` is a framework-agnostic library, so you can use it in any framework.

We're providing guides for the most popular frameworks:

- [React](./react.md)
- [Vue](./vue.md)
- [Angular](./angular.md)
- [Svelte](./svelte.md)
- [Next.js](../setup/next.md)

If you have a specific framework integration that you'd like to see here, please open an issue or a PR.

If you're looking for icon source integration, check out the following guides:

- [Exporting icons from Figma](./figma.md)
- [Integrating with Heroicons](./heroicons.md)
