# Using Figma Client

::: danger
WIP; TODO UPDATE BEFORE RELEASE
:::

Figma by itself provides consistent, but low-level and full of unnecessary details API to interact with Figma documents.

if you're using it directly or with some SDKs, you could face some problems, like a manual error handling, deep nesting of primary data, repeatative para and so on.
